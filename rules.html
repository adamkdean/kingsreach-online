                It is preferred that you RP both in General chat and in person. This gives a little bit more immersion to the game.

            <ol>
              <li>While outside of a claim, you are allowed to kill freely.</li>
              <li>If a player yields, they are allowed to offer you something in return for their life. This may be a trade, or a deal, etc. If you accept this, you are not allowed to kill them. If they do not offer you anything or you do not accept, then you may kill them.</li>
              <li> You may attack people inside their claims, with the following rules:
                  <ul class="bg-orange">
                    <li>If they yield, you are not to kill them, and must accept what they offer. A player must offer you something. If they refuse, you may kill them.</li>
                    <li>If they are sat down, and therefore AFK, you may not engage them.</li>
                    <li>If you engaged them outside of their claim and chased them into it, the regular rules apply, not the claim rules.</li>
                    <li>You must announce that you are there to conduct an attack</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>You are not to attack horses on claims, unless you are engaged in combat with someone mounted on a horse, then you may attack that horse.</li>
              <li>
                "The Colosseum" should be a totally safe zone. Unless taking part in an event, no one should engage another player within this area.

            <ol>
              <li>It’s not much fun when all you do is die constantly. Unfair, repeated killing and raiding of the same settlement counts as griefing.</li>
              <li>No spawn camping.</li>
              <li>No combat logging.</li>

            We are all in the same boat, so you can expect<span class="heavy orange"> active GMs without the abuse of power</span>. GM powers will only be used for resolving issues and enforcing the rules. We are open to suggestions, so if you think you have good idea, which may improve player experience on the server, we are all ears!

          <span class="heavy point">Server size:</span><br><br>
          The more the merrier! We have <span class="heavy orange">initially opened the server with 16 available player slots.</span> Once we can gauge how interested people are in staying on and actively playing, and find that it’s popular, we will increase the player slots to 32, and then 64 if necessary.

        <p class="copy">
          <span class="heavy point">Player abuse:</span><br><br>
          We want the server to be a nice place, and we want people to enjoy the server.  The gameplay should be as natural as possible, whilst still being enjoyable. You might encounter a few villains, bandits and beggars, but <span class="heavy orange">we won’t accept outright, hurtful abuse or bullying outside of RP.</span>
