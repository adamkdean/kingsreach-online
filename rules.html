            We are all in the same boat, so you can expect<span class="heavy orange"> active GMs without the abuse of power</span>. GM powers will only be used for resolving issues and enforcing the rules. We are open to suggestions, if you think you have good idea which may improve player experience on the server - we are all ears!

          The more the merrier! We have <span class="heavy orange">initially opened the server with 16 available player slots.</span> Once we can gauge how interested people are in staying on and actively playing, and find that it’s popular, we will increase the player slots to 32, and then 64 if necessary.

          <span class="heavy">Player Abuse:</span><br>
          We want the server to be a nice place, and we want people to enjoy the server.  The gameplay should be as natural as possible, whilst still being enjoyable. You might encounter a few villains, bandits and beggars, but <span class="heavy orange">we won’t accept outright, hurtful abuse or bullying outside of RP.</span>
