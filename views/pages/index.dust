          On 10 June 1030, the story began. Two brave adventurers arrived on the King's Reach from their distant homelands and began to settle the untamed and untapped peninsula. After much travel and toil, they pioneered the island's very first settlement â€“ the <a href="/map" class="anchor">Guild of Bastille</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="copy">
          By 22 June 1031, almost twenty guilds had been established, and more travellers arrived every day. From the grand castle in the Duchy of Vaugnberg to the wide spanning road systems of Bjorgvin, there were many new sights to be seen. Not all guilds had survived the first year.
        </p>
        <p class="copy">
          Do you think you have what it takes to set out and pioneer your very own settlement in the land's vastly, untapped wilds?

          Life is Feudal, and like any feudal system there is a natural order of status here on the server!<br><br>
          Will you be the Lord of a guild? Will you be a Duke and rule over one of the fourteen duchies? Perhaps you have what it takes to unite enough Dukes to become the King?

          We have introduced a Gold based <a href="/money" class="anchor">monetary system</a> to the server. There are no standard prices for goods or services. Traders are free to set their own prices, so you may need to barter for your much needed resources! There are many ways to accumulate gold, including stating a claim, winning an event, or even gaining a noble title.

          We eventually intend to introduce a <a href="/events" class="anchor">weekly event</a> to the server, likely to be held on a Friday or Saturday evening. These events, usually combat based, will take place at The Colosseum. The Colosseum (will be) a totally safe zone, where players can chill and enjoy watching the combatants tear each other apart. There are prizes to be won... think you've got what it takes?
