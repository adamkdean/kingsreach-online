            <ol>
              <li>Always be respectful to Wardens (moderators) and Keepers (GM) of the Realm</li>
              <li>It's not much fun when all you do is die constantly. Repeated killing and raiding of the same settlement counts as griefing.</li>
              <li>Building objects to scale walls (known as laddering) is strictly forbidden.</li>
              <li>Using horses and/or pole vaulting to breach walls is strictly forbidden.</li>
              <li>Being outright offensive in chat or over the microphone counts as griefing. Please keep things civil.</li>
              <li>No spawn camping – come on, be nice.</li>
              <li>No combat logging – come on, be brave.</li>
              <li>Sitting down whilst being attacked on your claim to avoid the attack will not be upheld in the rules of engagement</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="copy">
          <span class="heavy point">Rules of engagement</span><br><br>
            <ol>
              <li>While outside of a claim, you are allowed to kill freely.</li>
              <li>Killing people who yield is strictly forbidden.</li>
              <li>All attacks must have an RP basis.</li>
              <li>You may attack people inside their claims, with the following rules:
                  <ul class="bg-orange">
                    <li>If they are sat down, and therefore AFK, you may not engage them</li>
                    <li>If you initiated combat against them outside of their claim and chased them into it, the regular rules apply, not the claim rules</li>
                    <li>If a player leaves their claim, then general rules apply, not claim rules</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>You are not to attack horses on claims, unless you are engaged in combat with someone mounted on a horse, then you may attack that horse.</li>
              <!-- <li>"The Colosseum" should be a totally safe zone. Unless taking part in an event, no one should engage another player within this area. To do so may anger the Gods.</li> -->

        <p class="copy">
          <span class="heavy point">Claims</span><br><br>
            <ol>
              <li>The island is reserved for the Events Centre. You must not build there.</li>
              <li>The main mountain is off limits for claims. This is to ensure that everyone has access to its rich resources.</li>
              <li>Don't claim clay patches. Any claims which encompass a clay patch will be removed.</li>
              <li>Until Aug 27 2016, for every claim erected, the King's Bank will issue 100 Gold Pieces to the Guild Leader!</li>
              <li>The first person to erect a claim within a duchy will gain the right to claim the title of Duke/Duchess.</li>
              <li>With the support of four other Dukes/Duchesses, you may become King of those folks</li>
              <li><em>We are still working on usurping rules for duchies.</em> Got an idea? <a href="/contact" class="anchor">Let us know</a></li>

              <li>Only items which are either inside your claim or claimed by you, belong to you. All items outside of a claim essentially belong to no-one. Beware!</li>

            <ol>
              <li>This is an RP server, please treat it as such.</li>
              <li>Global chat is used only to ask for help from a GM or Moderator, keep meta talk to Discord.</li>
              <li>All interactions with other players should be RP in some form or other.</li>
              <li>If someone is RP'ing, you must not go OOC (Out of Character).</li>
              <li>Please keep all communications friendly and fair.</li>

            <ol>
              <li>You are restricted to a single character.</li>
              <li>You must ensure that you choose an RP friendly name.</li>
              <li>Your name must not be offensive, rude, or contain anything that is out of keeping with the server.</li>
              <li>You must not use a name that is popular in real-life culture, e.g. "Jack Sparrow", or "Robin Hood".</li>
              <li>Your name must follow proper casing. Bruce Jorval is fine. bruce jorval isn't. BrUcE JorVAL isn't either.</li>
              <li>You may be asked to change your name if it doesn't comply. If you're not around, it may be changed for you.</li>

            We are all in the same boat, so you can expect <span class="heavy orange">active GMs without the abuse of power</span>. GM powers will only be used for resolving issues and enforcing the rules. We are open to suggestions, so if you think you have good idea, which may improve player experience on the server, we are all ears!
        </p>
        <p class="copy">
          <span class="heavy point">Server size</span><br><br>
          The more the merrier! We <span class="heavy orange">initially opened the server with 32 available player slots.</span> Since we have had quite a bit of interest in the server, we have now updated the number of available slots to 64!
        </p>
        <p class="copy">
          <span class="heavy point">Player abuse</span><br><br>
          We want the server to be a nice place, and we want people to enjoy the server. The gameplay should be as natural as possible, whilst still being enjoyable. You might encounter a few villains, bandits, and beggars, but <span class="heavy orange">we won't accept outright, hurtful abuse or bullying.</span>

          <span class="heavy point">How to report</span><br><br>
            We strive to make the server a fun place for everyone. However, sometimes, issues will inevitably arise in game. If you have an issue or a complaint please <span class="heavy orange">screenshot and post it in the #issues channel on <a class="anchor" href="/contact">Discord</a></span> along with a description of your issue. This helps the GM's and Moderators to more effectively deal with the problem.
        </p>
        <p class="copy">
          <span class="heavy point">What we can do</span><br><br>
          We prefer to warn and Raid ban people. However, <span class="orange heavy">if the rules are repeatedly and intentionally broken, players risk receiving permanent Steam bans</span>. A Steam ban bans a player by their Steam account, which is essentially a perma-ban from the server.
